Everybody, I've come up with the
perfect plan to catch the bat.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:35.060
I bought this remote-

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:36.929

attached this handgun.

Peter, that doesn't seem very...
Here goes.

Now, I don't have anything
to control the trigger with,

00:01:43.404 --> 00:01:44.870
so I put it
on a timer.

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:46.738
But I don't remember
how long I set it...

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.774
Aah! We're all
gonna die!

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:54.713
Okay, so, now the bat has a gun
and the knives I gave him.

00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:56.248
What? Why would you
give him knives?

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.616

we're definitely not.

Ah, no, Lois,
don't tell me

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.157

It's not crap, Brian.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.727
There's a lot of evidence
to suggest there's a link

and autism.

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:40.665

evidence has been debunked.

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:46.204
"mercury, thimerosal,
aluminum, formaldehyde."

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:48.340
Lois, deciding
not to vaccinate Stewie

00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:49.541
is something
that affects all of us.

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:50.876
The only reason they work

00:06:50.878 --> 00:06:53.412
is that if a critical mass
of society gets immunized,

00:06:53.414 --> 00:06:54.780
then the diseases won't spread.

00:06:54.782 --> 00:06:56.615
Look, Brian,
I was skeptical, too,

00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:57.849
but then I did some research

00:06:57.851 --> 00:06:59.851

00:07:51.004 --> 00:07:52.170
about vaccinations.

00:07:52.172 --> 00:07:53.405
Yeah. I'm with you.

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:55.407
Just as soon as I finish
getting the word out

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:57.409
about the one thing
more important.

00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:59.911
The brothers who made
The Matrix are ladies now!

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:00.979
They're ladies!

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:02.314
Just one of 'em?

00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:04.082
That's the thing--
it's both of 'em!

00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:05.283
What are the chances?

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:06.751
What are the chances?!

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:09.888
The brothers who made
The Matrix are ladies now!

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.596
All right, come on, Peter,

00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:20.432
I've got all the stuff
for our anti-vaccination rally.

00:08:20.434 --> 00:08:21.433
I don't believe this.

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:22.434
It's bad enough you guys

00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:23.602
aren't vaccinating Stewie.

00:08:23.604 --> 00:08:24.769
Now you're trying
to convince other people

00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:26.271
to make the same
reckless choice?

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:28.773
I'm also gonna pet
a bunch of dogs without asking.

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:30.108
Don't do that.
We don't like that.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.943
Then I'm gonna try
and look at their teeth.

00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:34.980
Brian, all we want is
for parents to have the choice.

00:08:34.982 --> 00:08:37.549
Because parents know
what's best for their kids.

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:40.418
I hear Sansa finally
shows boob in this one.

00:08:42.456 --> 00:08:44.456
You do realize they're
putting your life in danger

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:45.857
by not getting you immunized.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.727
You could get measles, mumps,
rubella, whooping cough...

00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:50.028
Oh, my God,
are you serious?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.397
Very serious.
Even the tiniest germ

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:54.966
could make you very ill and,
left untreated, kill you.

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:55.967
Really?

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:56.968
I'd expect this kind of thing

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.670
from the fat man but not Lois.

00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:00.472
Although she did
act like a nutcase

00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:03.174
that time she went shopping
right before Thanksgiving.

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:04.910
Ready for Turkey Day?

00:09:04.912 --> 00:09:06.545
(chuckles) Clever.

00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:08.313
Don't eat too much turkey
tomorrow.

00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:10.482
(chuckles) Oh, I won't.

00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:13.151
Now, if only the meal would
cook itself, huh?

00:09:13.153 --> 00:09:17.489
(cackles loudly)

00:09:18.492 --> 00:09:19.758
(over P.A.):
Parents of Quahog

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.494
and weekend dads
playing three minutes of catch,

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:24.996
do you know that
the number of childhood vaccines

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:27.065
has tripled
in the last generation?

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.366
And why is that?

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:31.536
Because heartless corporations
make billions of dollars

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:35.006
by foisting garbage
and poison upon our children.

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:41.446
We demand that these vaccines

00:09:41.448 --> 00:09:44.182
be tested by
independent researchers,

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:46.351
not by the companies
who make them.

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:48.553
Excuse me, are you the lady
selling the bullhorn?

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:49.888
What? No.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.023
I'm over here.

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:53.925
(sighs) Damn it.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.694
This doesn't
seem to be working.

00:09:55.696 --> 00:09:56.895
Well, obviously, Lois.

00:09:56.897 --> 00:09:58.029
You can't just go to a park

00:09:58.031 --> 00:09:59.864
and list a bunch
of boring facts.

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:01.232
You got to spice things up.

00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:02.867
Like I did when
I was a lounge singer

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:04.603
with uneven lyric density.

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:08.039
This is a song I wrote
for my beautiful girlfriend.

00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:09.140
Her name is...

(plays final note)

00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:46.411
(rhythmic tapping)

00:10:48.248 --> 00:10:51.116
(rhythmic clinking)

00:10:51.118 --> 00:10:53.318
(rhythmic ice rattling)

00:10:57.457 --> 00:10:59.090
(claps)
Yeah, that's enough of that.

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:00.158
What the hell?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.993
Peter, is that you
on TV right now?

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.929
Oh, yeah, that's my
anti-vaccination PSA.

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:06.498
Hi, I'm a medical guy,

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.301
and I'm here to give you
the facts about vaccs.

00:11:10.303 --> 00:11:13.271
Fact: vaccinations cause autism,

00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:15.306
paralysis, and even...

00:11:15.308 --> 00:11:16.608
death, death, death, death,
death, death, death,

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.109
death, death, death.

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:21.312
Fact: "vaccinate"
rhymes with "masturbate."

00:11:21.314 --> 00:11:23.982
Would you let a doctor
do that to your kid?

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:27.952
Fact: I still think Michelle
Williams is Carey Mulligan.

00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:29.621
Fact!

00:11:29.623 --> 00:11:32.490
Medical delivery
for badass karate doctor.

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:34.826
Ah, yes, those must be
the bones and skulls.

00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:36.561
(bones clattering)

00:11:36.563 --> 00:11:39.464
I see no boob bones;
the victim was a man.

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:40.565
Wow.

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:43.134
SINGER:
♪ Oh, yeah! ♪

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:45.036
ANNOUNCER:
Say "no" to vaccines.

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.971
Paid for with Meg's
college fund.

00:11:53.914 --> 00:11:55.313
What the hell is all this?

00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:57.348
I'm trying to protect myself
from all those diseases

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.050
I'm not vaccinated against.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.352
Speaking of which, do
you have any idea the germs

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:03.555
you routinely
track into this house?

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:05.657
From now on I'm going to
ask that you wear these shoes

00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:06.658
while indoors.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.726
Where'd you get those?

00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:08.927
Put 'em on and lick your lips!

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:10.762
Stewie, you might be
taking this too far.

00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:13.098
Proper hygiene depends
on everyone, Brian.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.567
For instance, I've already
Saran-Wrapped Chris.

00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:18.169
(muffled):
I'm a gas station sandwich!

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:19.838
(dramatic music on TV)

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.440
We interrupt this program
with breaking news.

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:25.009
Childhood vaccination rates
in Quahog have dropped

00:12:25.011 --> 00:12:28.413
to an all-time low, fueled
by a recent media campaign

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:30.548
led by local meddler
Peter Griffin,

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.952
shown here in the basket
of Henry Thomas' bicycle.

00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:35.854
That can't be real, right?

00:12:35.856 --> 00:12:39.057
Oh, I knew one of these
had to be my house.

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:40.425
Damn it, Peter, thanks to you,

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:42.927
nobody in this town is
vaccinating their kids anymore!

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.963
Do you even realize
the harm you've caused?

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:46.297
Harm?
What are you talking about?

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:48.032
I'm making the world
a better place.

00:12:48.034 --> 00:12:50.235
Like when I was
the Instagram police.

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:52.303
(siren wails, then stops)

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:54.038
Sorry, lady, got to crop
the chotch.

00:12:57.144 --> 00:13:00.378
I... will take this.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.046
And cutaway complete.

00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:03.548
(siren wails)

00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:11.589
Man, there is a lot of bad art
in these hallways.

00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:14.492
All right, Stewie,
see you after school.

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.728
Wait a minute, where
are all the other kids?

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.762
Haven't you heard?

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:19.397
There's been an
outbreak of measles.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:21.666
It's all because everyone
stopped vaccinating their kids.

00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:23.234
Oh, my God!

00:13:23.236 --> 00:13:24.602
And it's not just our school.

00:13:24.604 --> 00:13:26.137
Kids all over town
are getting sick.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.605
(air raid siren blares)

00:13:27.607 --> 00:13:28.973
OFFICIAL (over bullhorn):
Attention! Attention!

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.708
What the hell?

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:35.246
(crowd clamoring,
sirens wailing)

00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:36.915
People of Quahog,

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:39.083
your town is under quarantine.

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:43.087
Until further notice, no one
may enter or leave the city.

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:46.024
Oh, that's the guy who bought
the bullhorn at the park.

00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:47.492
Oh, this is awful.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:48.993
It's all our fault!

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.662
And look, Joe's arguing
with a state policeman

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:52.263
over jurisdiction.

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:54.299
Thanks, Swanson,
we'll take it from here.

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:55.633
It's a state matter now.

00:13:55.635 --> 00:13:57.602
No way, this is my town.

00:13:57.604 --> 00:13:59.704
Thanks, guys, the feds
will take it from here.

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:01.840
Oh, no, this is my state.

00:14:01.842 --> 00:14:03.975
Hi, I'm a crossing
guard who can walk,

00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:06.344
so I have jurisdiction
over all of you.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.879
Must be serious.

00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:09.881
They brought in the big guns.

00:14:16.323 --> 00:14:18.356
You happy now, Lois?

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.158
Because of you,
there's a measles epidemic,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.793
and the whole town
is quarantined.

00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:23.161
Speak for yourself, Brian.

00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:26.297
I, for one, am enjoying
the indoor family time.

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:29.234
Who's up for another game
of hot-breath telephone?

00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:31.202
(loud, mumbled whisper)

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:32.904
We're all gonna die!

00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:35.039
Chris, you're supposed to
whisper that to the next person.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.541
Peter, Brian's right!

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:38.009
We were wrong about everything!

00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:40.845
We've got to get to the hospital
and get Stewie vaccinated!

00:14:40.847 --> 00:14:42.714
Eh, it might be a little
too late for that.

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:45.617
I kind of destroyed
all the vaccines in town.

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:10.942
All right, what else
did I have to do today?

00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:12.911
Ah, yes, overdose
in my apartment.

00:15:12.913 --> 00:15:14.512
I better get home.

00:15:14.514 --> 00:15:16.714
You destroyed all the vaccines?

00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:18.850
Yeah, but it's fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

00:15:18.852 --> 00:15:20.785
Is anyone else
feeling feverish, achy,

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:22.453
and acutely sensitive to light?

00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:23.855
Oh, my God, Peter.

00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:25.523
Y-You've got measles!

00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:28.026
Now, hold on, hold on,
before we all freak out,

00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:29.727
it might just
be full-body herpes.

00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:32.530
Wait, you guys, Dad might
not have been vaccinated.

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:34.365
Didn't Grandma say
he was born in Mexico?

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:35.767
Nobody remembers that, Meg.

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:37.769
We got to keep you away
from Stewie.

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:38.870
You'll get him sick.

00:15:38.872 --> 00:15:40.705
Oh, my little guy's
gonna be fine.

00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:42.407
All he needs is a good,
old-fashioned game

00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:44.375
of hot-breath telephone.

00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:45.643
(breathy whisper):
Measles.

00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:47.211
(yells) I've got to get
out of this house,

00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:49.747
or I'll be in worse shape
than John Goodman!

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:51.249
I've got your EKG here.

00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:52.417
How does it look?

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:54.585
Well, it spells out "Pancakes."

00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:56.988
Oh, okay, so same as last time.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.091
I'm recommending you go on
a strict diet immediately.

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:01.392
Nope.

00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:03.227
Horses that make it look
like I can walk,

00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:05.163
take me to Hollywood!

00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:15.940
All right,
I'm almost done packing.

00:16:15.942 --> 00:16:18.509
I've got it down to four bags
and a hatbox.

00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:19.844
I'm gonna need some help,
Rupert.

00:16:19.846 --> 00:16:20.945
Rupert?

00:16:20.947 --> 00:16:24.115
Ew, that's the tushie
thermometer.

00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:26.184
Dear God, you're burning up!

00:16:26.186 --> 00:16:27.485
I have to get out of here!

00:16:29.122 --> 00:16:30.521
I'm sorry, Rupert,

00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:32.690
but the situation here
has become unbearable.

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:35.593
Like talking to someone
with adult braces.

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:37.762
So, yeah, last weekend,
Sheila and I took the kids

00:16:37.764 --> 00:16:39.263
up to the lake, it was great.

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:41.933
We had great weather,
fired up the barbecue,

00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:43.868
Sheila's parents came up
towards the end of the week...

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.270
When are you gonna
get those off?!

00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:54.012
(weakly): Meg, you must
carry on my legacy.

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:57.382
Promise me you'll crop
the chotches.

00:16:57.384 --> 00:16:58.816
Crop them, Meg!

00:16:58.818 --> 00:17:00.051
Crop them all!

00:17:00.053 --> 00:17:01.853
LOIS:
Peter, Stewie's gone!

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.388
I've looked everywhere!

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.124
Oh, Lois, I feel
a little better.

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:08.126
I think I could keep down
deviled eggs.

00:17:08.128 --> 00:17:09.127
Lois, what's wrong?

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:10.528
I can't find Stewie.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.296
He must've gotten
out of the house.

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:14.966
God knows how far he's gone.

00:17:14.968 --> 00:17:17.802
Well, look, there's
a Family Circus dotted path.

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:19.037
It'll lead us right to him.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.143
BRIAN:
Ah, it's just Billy.

00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:26.677
He died of measles.

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:30.148
And here comes Marmaduke
to lick up the vomit.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.949
Lucky.

00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:37.688
If I can just escape
this quarantine

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.856
and make it to the next town,

00:17:38.858 --> 00:17:42.060
I'll be able to get
that vaccine I need.

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:44.062
Stewie!
I'm you from the future!

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.497
You've got to get the hell out
of town before you get sick!

00:17:46.499 --> 00:17:48.332
Yeah, I know.
That's what I'm doing.

00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:50.535
Okay, I'm really here
because I know you have glue.

00:17:50.537 --> 00:17:52.937
Give me the glue.

00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:56.107
(inhales deeply, then moans)

00:17:56.109 --> 00:17:57.341
Stewie, listen to me,

00:17:57.343 --> 00:18:00.244
never, ever do this
great thing I love.

00:18:08.354 --> 00:18:10.655
There's the bridge out of town!

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:14.692
So we're all there at the Clam,

00:18:14.694 --> 00:18:16.527
just kind of
making music together,

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:18.696
and then Peter,
of course, had to join in

00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:22.400
and clap his hands, and I said,
"Eh, that's enough of that."

00:18:22.402 --> 00:18:24.769
(chuckles)
Yeah, I kind of run the group.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.272
I'll just have
to go around them.

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:37.315
Good Lord.

00:18:37.317 --> 00:18:39.217
I hope my shoe doesn't fall
to make me realize

00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:40.551
how far the drop is.

00:18:43.823 --> 00:18:45.256
(splash in the distance)

00:18:45.258 --> 00:18:48.126
Oh, my orthotic was in there.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:49.894
(tires screech)

00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:51.329
Stewie?

00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:52.396
Where are you?

00:18:52.398 --> 00:18:54.265
Lois, what's going on?

00:18:54.267 --> 00:18:56.234
That's one of
my sidekicks' wives.

00:18:56.236 --> 00:18:58.269
He says he's in charge
of the group, is that true?

00:18:58.271 --> 00:19:01.172
No, not in the slightest,
but, Joe, Stewie's gone missing.

00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:02.907
We can't find him anywhere.

00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:04.475
Lois, look!

00:19:05.578 --> 00:19:07.778
(grunting)

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.580
I don't know if he can
hold on much longer.

00:19:09.582 --> 00:19:10.581
We got to get him down.

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:12.016
Stewie, hang on!

00:19:12.018 --> 00:19:13.251
Mommy's coming!

00:19:13.253 --> 00:19:15.186
(train whistle blows)

00:19:16.756 --> 00:19:19.991
Oh, no, upside-down train!

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.159
(yells)

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:23.494
Stewie!
Oh, no!

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:24.996
(continues yelling)

00:19:28.768 --> 00:19:30.101
Sean Penn?

00:19:30.103 --> 00:19:32.436
That's right, two-time
Oscar winner Sean Penn.

00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:33.771
What are you doing here?

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:36.274
I'm bringing vaccines
into your quarantined town.

00:19:36.276 --> 00:19:38.876
Any time there's a public health
crisis in a third-world land,

00:19:38.878 --> 00:19:39.944
I'm there.

00:19:39.946 --> 00:19:41.779
Third world?
This is Rhode Island.

00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:43.014
Oh, really?

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:45.049
Have you seen some
of the delis on Federal Hill?

00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:46.717
Oh-ho-ho! Rhode Island slam!

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:49.787
Ho-ho! I like you, Sean Penn.

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:54.125
Oh, my God, you saved my baby!

00:19:54.127 --> 00:19:56.827
Thank you so mu-- Oh.

00:19:56.829 --> 00:19:58.729
Sean Penn.

00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:01.799
Y-You're the one who played
that homosexual.
Yeah.

00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:04.001
All right, well,
I'll take my son now.

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:06.470
I've brought enough vaccines
for your whole town.

00:20:06.472 --> 00:20:08.339
I hope you've realized
that vaccinations are not

00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:11.309
a freedom of choice issue,
they're a public health issue.

00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:14.712
Thanks to them, countless
serious diseases, mumps, polio,

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.682
smallpox, and rubella,
have been all but eradicated.

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:19.684
Like clean water and
functional schools,

00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:22.186
vaccinations are a human right.

00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:25.656
Great, just what I needed, a
lecture from liberal Hollywood.

00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:29.760
This whole thing has been a
lecture from liberal Hollywood.

00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:35.866
Well, it's a relief that
everyone's been vaccinated

00:20:35.868 --> 00:20:37.401
and the quarantine
has been lifted.

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:39.503
Well, I'm just happy
that Stewie is healthy,

00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:43.007
and only 150 people died, but
not anyone we knew personally.

00:20:43.009 --> 00:20:45.509
Yeah, I know I sure
learned something.

00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:46.677
(tapping on window)

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:48.546
Hey, do you like apples?

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:50.181
Yeah.

00:20:50.183 --> 00:20:51.515
Well, I got her number.

00:20:51.517 --> 00:20:52.850
How do you like them apples?

00:20:52.852 --> 00:20:54.452
Oh, Bat Damon!

00:20:54.454 --> 00:20:56.454
You got the best of me again!
